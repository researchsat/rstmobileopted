## **Our Core Technology Portfolio**

**Advanced Laboratory Modules for Space Research**

Our engineering team has developed a sophisticated portfolio of miniaturized laboratory systems, each designed to operate autonomously in the challenging conditions of space while delivering unprecedented research capabilities.

**Cell Culture Module (CCM)**
Our Cell Culture Module represents a breakthrough in space-based biological research, featuring a miniaturized laboratory platform with precise atmospheric control and automated mechanisms for cell, tissue, and organ cultivation during microgravity phases. The system incorporates advanced microfluidic technology, embedded sensors, and real-time monitoring capabilities that enable researchers to study stem cell differentiation, organ-on-chip applications, and complex tissue development in ways that terrestrial laboratories cannot match.

The module's integrated fluorescence microscopy and dielectric spectroscopy systems provide highly magnified cellular imaging and quantified growth data, while automated culture replacement mechanisms ensure optimal experimental conditions throughout the mission duration. This technology serves pharmaceutical companies developing regenerative medicine therapies and biotechnology firms working on advanced drug delivery systems.

**Protein Crystallisation Module (PCM)**
Protein crystallization in microgravity produces larger, more perfect crystals with superior molecular structures compared to Earth-based methods. Our Protein Crystallisation Module leverages this advantage through sophisticated microfluidic systems and thermally controlled crystallization chambers that enable pharmaceutical companies to accelerate drug development timelines and improve therapeutic efficacy.

The module's automated electronic control systems regulate fluidic, chemical, and environmental factors with precision, while specialized collection chambers preserve newly formed crystals for subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis. This technology is particularly valuable for companies developing protein-based therapeutics, where crystal quality directly impacts drug formulation and delivery effectiveness.

**Double Emulsion Module**
Building upon our successful suborbital mission experience, our Double Emulsion Module generates multiple emulsions within carefully controlled microfluidic platforms. This technology enables revolutionary advances in targeted drug delivery and cell encapsulation applications, allowing pharmaceutical researchers to develop more effective treatments with reduced side effects.

The system's fail-resilient imaging capabilities capture emulsion formation in real-time, while integrated freezing systems preserve samples for Earth-based analysis. This technology is transforming how drugs are delivered to specific target sites within the human body, potentially revolutionizing treatment protocols for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and other complex medical conditions.

**Cell Bank & Data Bank Module**
Our most ambitious project involves establishing a permanent biological research facility aboard the International Space Station and future commercial orbital platforms. The Cell Bank & Data Bank Module serves as a specialized repository for storing and cultivating cells under the unique conditions of space radiation and long-term microgravity exposure.

This facility enables the cultivation of cellular mutations and biological variants that cannot be produced on Earth, potentially leading to breakthrough discoveries in pharmaceutical drug development and regenerative medicine. The integrated data collection and transmission systems provide real-time monitoring and analysis capabilities, ensuring that valuable research data is continuously available to ground-based teams.

## **Mission Capabilities Across All Altitudes**

**Comprehensive Launch Solutions for Every Research Need**

ResearchSat offers a complete spectrum of mission types, each optimized for specific research objectives and budget requirements. Our mission planning expertise ensures that every payload achieves maximum scientific value while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

**Atmospheric Balloon Launches**
Our atmospheric balloon program provides an accessible entry point for initial microgravity research, reaching altitudes of 35 kilometers and delivering up to 60 seconds of microgravity during the free-fall phase. These missions are ideal for proof-of-concept experiments and educational programs, with launch frequencies of up to twice weekly and payload capabilities supporting experiments under 1.5 kilograms.

The program serves both academic institutions developing student research programs and industrial clients seeking cost-effective preliminary data before committing to longer-duration missions. Real-time data transmission via radiosondes ensures immediate access to experimental results.

**Suborbital Rocket Missions**
Our suborbital rocket partnerships deliver 6-10 minutes of high-quality microgravity at altitudes reaching 300 kilometers. These missions provide sufficient duration for complex biological and pharmaceutical experiments while maintaining reasonable cost structures. Our 1U payload format accommodates sophisticated experimental systems including dual-experiment configurations.

Working with established launch providers like Swedish Space Corporation, we ensure reliable access to suborbital environments with annual launch opportunities and expanding availability through emerging Australian launch providers.

**International Space Station (ISS) Integration**
Our ISS mission capabilities represent the pinnacle of space-based research opportunities, providing weeks to months of continuous microgravity exposure. Through partnerships with SpaceX and other commercial space transportation providers, we deliver complex experimental payloads that can generate entirely new classes of biological materials and pharmaceutical compounds.

These long-duration missions enable the development of novel therapeutics and biological materials with commercial values potentially reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, making them highly attractive investments for pharmaceutical companies seeking breakthrough discoveries.

**Orbital Satellite Deployments**
For extended research programs requiring years of space exposure, our orbital satellite capabilities provide the ultimate platform for long-term studies.
